1)  Maximal <canvas> size: 8192x8192, width bigger than ~30000px (100px height)
    is not rendered. Bigger causes page to crash (Aw Snap...).
    
    Solution: Split clip display to more canvases (e.g. 5000x100) -- done
    Ad solution: it's not accurate (end of clip is out of canvas -- with bigger zoom is bigger the crop)...

2)  Big audio files in memory... 

3) Resizing clip to the left (at left track border) causes 'negative overflow' of the startTime.
